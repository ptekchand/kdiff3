KDiff3-Readme
=============

Author: Joachim Eibl  (joachim.eibl at gmx.de)
Port to KF5/Qt5 by Michael Reeves (reeves.87@gmail.com)
KDiff3-Version: 1.7.90

Now requires Qt 5.6 or later and KF5 5.14+. Legacy 0.9.98 and earlier builds are not supported.
MacOSX build is untested since port. The Konqueror specific plugin is not ported and no longer maintained.
This plugin would only apply to KDE before 4.6. Support as been removed from main CMakeLists.txt.
As of 1/13/17 cmake 3.1+ is the targeted cmake version.


cmake is now the only build system supported. KF5/Qt5 was big jump. A lot changed besides just the API.
I am not against a Qt5-only build variant but see no reason to maintain two separate build systems.
At present KF5 is my focus.

The original pre KF5/Qt5 Readme follows old build instructions have been removed to avoid confusion:

KDiff3 runs best on KDE but can be built without it, depending only on Qt-libs.
These are available for Un*x, Windows, Mac.
Thus there are many setup possibilities to consider.

Supported Qt-versions: 4.8, 5.2 or higher.
Supported KDE-version: 4, 5
(For KDE3/Qt3 use KDiff3-0.9.92 or older.)

Introduction
------------

KDiff3 is a program that
- compares and merges two or three input files or directories,
- shows the differences line by line and character by character (!),
- provides an automatic merge-facility and
- an integrated editor for comfortable solving of merge-conflicts
- has support for KDE-KIO (ftp, sftp, http, fish, smb),
- has an intuitive graphical user interface,
- provides a context menu for KDE-Dolphin and Windows-Explorer,
- supports 64 bit systems. (Some build issues are discussed in here.)
- Support for many encodings and Unicode.

Additional hints
----------------

   Start from commandline:
   - Comparing 2 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2
   - Merging 2 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 -o outputfile
   - Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2 file3
   - Merging 3 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 file3 -o outputfile
        Note that file1 will be treated as base of file2 and file3.

   If all files have the same name but are in different directories, you can
   reduce typework by specifying the filename only for the first file. E.g.:
   - Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 dir1/filename dir2 dir3
   (This also works in the open-dialog.)

   If you start without arguments, then a dialog will appear where you can
   select your files via a filebrowser.

   For more documentation, see the help-menu or the subdirectory doc.

   Have fun!

   - Install Craft: https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source/Windows#Installing_Craft
     PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
     PS> iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KDE/craft/master/setup/install_craft.ps1'))
     # Example location (Replace `D:\Users\UserName\Documents\CraftRoot` with whatever you use):
     PS> D:\Users\UserName\Documents\CraftRoot\craft\craftenv.ps1

     Following hints/commands are usually meant to run in the Craft (PowerShell) environment
   - Run: `craft kdiff3` (in the Craft (PowerShell) environment)

   - Generate solution to debug using VS2017:
     # Desired location example
     PS> cd D:\Users\UserName\Documents\CraftRoot\build\kde\unreleased\kdiff3\vs_sln_dir
     # The "build\_\73890534\kdiff3" is the location where kdiff3 source got downloaded (and linked)
     # eg: 73890534 [D:\Users\UserName\Documents\CraftRoot\download\git\kde\unreleased]
     PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DBUILD_TESTING=ON   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="D:/Users/UserName/Documents/CraftRoot" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="D:/Users/UserName/Documents/CraftRoot" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP=ON -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON "D:\Users\UserName\Documents\CraftRoot\build\_\73890534\kdiff3"

   - To package:
      PS> `craft nsis`  # Install dependency
      PS> craft --package kdiff3
